@import '../../00-base/config';

// To change default bootstrap nav variables,
// copy from ~bootstrap/scss/variables to here

//find real example!!!!
$btn-border-radius: 0.25rem;

//also, doesnt this inherently lead to the double imports that we were trying to avoid earlier?
@import "~bootstrap/scss/nav";

// Add custom code here

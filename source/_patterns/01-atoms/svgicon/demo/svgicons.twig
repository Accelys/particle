    <h1>SVG Icons</h1>
    <p class="lead">SVG Icons are converted from a raw SVG to an SVG Spritesheet which can be referred to by name and passed additional parameters, such as changing the fill color. Icons can be rendered to the screen with a Sass mixin or by including the <code>_svgicon.twig</code> file with arguments.</p>

  <h2>Using Sass mixin</h2>
  <p>The Sass mixin is located in the components scss/_icons-generated.scss file which is generated by the Webpack plugin on build. At build time, a map is created using the SVG filename as the key and the path as the value.</p> 
  <pre class="language-css">
    <code>
      .svgicon-demo-0 {
        @include sprite('chevron-right');
        height: 20px;
      }
    </code>
  </pre>

<div class="svgicon-demo-0">
</div>

  <p>Additionally, variables can be declared in the source SVG with accompanying defaults to allow for mutation of these variables within the mixin. These follow the pattern <code>var:[$name.]$attribute="[$defaultvalue]"</code>. For example SVGs all have <code>var:color.fill="#000"</code> on the path element to allow updating the fill color as an argument to the mixin.</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      .svgicon-demo-1 {
        @include sprite('person', (color: theme-color('primary')));
        height: 20px;
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
      
  <div class="svgicon-demo-1">
  </div>

  <div class="svgicon-demo-2">
  </div>
{% include '@atoms/_svgicon.twig' with {svgname: 'chevron-up', svgfill: '#0F0'} %}
